## Installation Guidelines

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- MongoDB

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JaakkoLipp/AWP-Project.git
   cd AWP-Project
   ```
2. **(optional) Set up the environment variables**:
   Create or edit a `.env` file in the server folder of the project containing the JWT secret. (default provided)
   ```
   SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   Automated scripts (2):
   ```
   npm run client-install
   npm run server-install
   ```
   **OR** manually from the root folder (3):
   ```
   npm install
   cd client && npm install
   cd server && npm install
   ```
4. **One command dev-start**:
   ```
   npm run dev

   ```
   cd server
   npm start
   ```
6. **Start the frontend application (Alternative)**:
