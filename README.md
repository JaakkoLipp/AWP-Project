# Text Only "Tinder Clone" Project Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the Tinder Clone App, detailing the technology choices, installation guidelines, and a user manual. The Tinder Clone App is a web application that allows users to register, log in, like, dislike or swipe through user profiles, and chat with matched users.

## Installation Guidelines

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- MongoDB

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   `git clone https://github.com/JaakkoLipp/AWP-Project.git`
2. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```
   cd AWP-Project
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up the environment variables**:
   Create or edit a `.env` file in the root of your project containing the JWT secret.
   ```
   SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   Automated scripts (2):
   ```
   npm run client-install
   npm run server-install
   ```
   manually from the root folder (3):
   `npm install`
   `cd client && npm install`
   `cd server && npm install`
5. **One command dev-start**:
   `npm run dev`
6. **Start the backend server**:
   `npm start`
7. **Start the frontend application**:
   `npm start`

"scripts": {
"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
"client-install": "npm install && cd client && npm install",
"dev:client": "cd client && npm start",
"server-install": "cd server && npm install",
"dev:server": "cd server && npm run dev",
"build": "cd client && npm run build",
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev:client\" \"npm run dev:server\""
},
The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`, with a default mongodb instance at `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
